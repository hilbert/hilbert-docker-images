# hitsfat

This is a "fat image" for HITS interactives that contains many packages that
are used by our interactives. While the image is very big, essentially all
interactives are tiny add-ons, which saves space and eases maintenance.

The fonts in "fonts/HelveticaNeueLTOT" are non-free and only licensed for use by ESO.
